Game Design
------------
Action game of sorts. User flies through black/colored tron-like landscape. Balls are ejected into the air in reponse to the music (procedurally generated) and the user must collect these. User looses health/points if flies too far off of track (make it look like the landscape ends in some abyss). Landscape is city-scape like. The "feel" of the landscape (color, lighting effects, quickness of movement) changes based on the the tempo or music genre if we get to it.


User Interaction
------------------
User flies through some changing landscape. Avoids obstacles. Collects procedurally generated balls. At some point the game ends with a time limit -- song end. 
User has full control but must stay within certain radius of center of sphere
User travels along a spherical landscape -- idea is a planet
User can move up,down,left,right

Think guitar hero....



ACCOMPLISHED
------------
- procedurally generated balls
- bloom effects, and all of unitys built in shaders
- objects changing in response to music
- basic game design


WEEK GOALS
-----------
- generate linear path with balls generating along them
- create spherical landscape 
- have user move along the sphere

 
END GOALS
--------
- prototype for the landscape
- different themes (lighting effects, maybe shapes)
- scoring schemes
- analyzing tempo/genre from songs
- user interactions
- score keeping and tutorial
- what is the player -- look into journey esc games for character design 
- pick the shapes that generate (balls, abstract...)
